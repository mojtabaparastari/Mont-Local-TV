you can see my prediction on market_share_predict.csv .
at first i should train a model with train dataset for that i need to do preprocessing that i should use some metrics and tools like
visualization tools and mean and std .
and i should imputation some variable and drop some of them.
after that our data ready for train .
i use some method that i can use for predicting continuous response variable.
after that I have to evaluate modeles and choose best of them. for this i use MAE MSE Accuracy R-square.
after choose the best model we can use that for predicting test dataset set.
before that we need to preprocess test dataset.
